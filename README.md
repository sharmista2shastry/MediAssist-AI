Project: MediAssist AI

- Description:

MediAssist, an Healthcare AI Assistant, is a state-of-the-art text-to-SQL system designed to revolutionize data accessibility and analytics in the healthcare industry. This project can interpret natural language queries, generate SQL queries, and fetch results from a PostgreSQL database, all in an intuitive and user-friendly way. It utilizes the power of Azure AI's OpenAI GPT-4 model, integrated with a Streamlit GUI for an enhanced interaction experience. This project has been coded in Python and leverages langchain to answer user queries.

- Key Features:

1. Natural Language Processing: Uses Azure AI's OpenAI GPT-4 to interpret and respond to user queries in natural language.
2. SQL Query Generation: Dynamically generates SQL queries based on the user's natural language input.
3. Database Interaction: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to retrieve query results, demonstrating practical database interaction.
4. Streamlit GUI: Features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, making it easy for users of all skill levels.
5. Python-based: Entirely coded in Python, showcasing best practices in software development with modern technologies.

- How It Works:

The chatbot works by taking a user's natural language query, converting it into a SQL query using Azure AI's OpenAI GPT-4, executing the query on a PostgreSQL database, and then presenting the results back to the user in natural language. This process involves several steps of data processing and interaction with the OpenAI API and a SQL database, all seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application.

- Use Cases:

1. Clinical Data Retrieval: Doctors can quickly access patient records with specific conditions and treatment history.
2. Administrative Reporting: Administrators can generate reports on various metrics such as average hospital stay and patient demographics.
3. Predictive Analytics: Researchers can predict patient readmission rates and other health outcomes using integrated ML models.
